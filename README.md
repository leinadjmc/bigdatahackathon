# bigdatahackathon
BigDataBelfast hackathon at PwC

This was a hackathon that I attended with some friends from uni. From 7PM through to 7AM we were tasked with mining through data sets provided by Belfast City Council to develop solutions as to how they could improve the quality of public areas such as parks.

Whilst burning the midnight oil we hacked away at some challenges along with drinking many cups of coffee and eating pizza.

During the night I taught myself how to write a basic HTML scraping script using python, and this was the result. 
The .py file was used to scrape relevent data from the corresponding sites on this RSS feed; http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/events/Events-RSS.aspx which we then parsed into a CSV, cleaned and put through Power BI to get some visualisations.
